-- Baseline migration for existing database schema
-- This migration represents the initial state of the database before Flyway was introduced

-- This file is intentionally left with minimal content
-- The actual tables (emails, contacts, campaigns, etc.) already exist in the database
-- Flyway will baseline on this version and track future migrations from V2 onwards

-- Just a comment to mark the baseline
